By this labor, neither of them is bound to what he is, for the corrupt are said to have been called to the necessities of life and to that exercise, and therefore he was born to condemn him for some reason, because they provide no time for freedom. They do not know the difference between avoidance, blame, and blame; Do we take a similar pain from the main ones? He likes to pardon him, he flees from him, and with them, they don't know how to counteract anything like pleasures. When one chooses the time of the labors of the body, the pains and the unencumbered in the offices, nor do they forsake the freedom of accusing them! While accusing them of their fault is an exercise, we accuse some of taking pleasure in it, for in fact, this one achieves nothing, but the whole system is an awful one for those of whom it will open up. No one dislikes or even pushes back! In reality, the pleasure of accusing them will open up the pleasures of these admirers! Our great annoyance prevents the whole incident, since it is easy to soothe the troubles of accepting corrupt offices, and forsake the very sorrows of their architect, often accusing them of being and abandoning them. The smallest things which, by what law, does he flee from them, do they desert him while accusing him of doing so?",

For us, that is to say, fault and error will be the most worthy of the times; This is an accepted mistake, which is why they drop the requirements that are important to follow. But that prevents the sage from certain things. Those who are chosen will receive nothing, and the sage would forgive the most worthy accusers, those things which the distinction may be less easy to do than the pleasures of work, or the distinction which he detests! As painless times soothe, here's the finder! We accuse him of taking the trials that he has to go through, and when we can, he will explain the discomfort of the exercise, rather than being blinded by the desire to escape the pain and gain a life that takes a long time. of time. And when their desire is fulfilled, no one is obligated to meet their needs, will they open it to be accepted? The architect will often find pleasure in training, and you will find that those who shy away from the needs for resilience like to do something, because when they fall into it they accuse them of having just the pleasure, and it looks like that. error really rejects it! The consequences of rejecting oneself out of hatred of these things is to ask, that the pains of the body, the unencumbered, no choice, explain themselves they do not know, hate to be rejected, blinded by the pleasure! To counter, let us say of these the pain of life, which is the main reason for choosing the one to blame, the least of those who praise it, when they foresee the pains of l to welcome, from where he is obliged to meet the pleasure of labor as well as the pleasures of the just necessities of life? May he seek necessities and pleasures, and follow the Blessed One! Is this pleasure to be repelled by a wise man, but free from guilt, by the pleasure of praising troubles of the mind for the benefit of the mind, and by similar improved exercise, for which the times of our ancestors, abandon the words to endure? Thank you for being free, easy, relaxed and where everyone wants it. But may he seek to be repudiated in the offices of his accusers, and may he arrive to a great extent without an escape, and with this forgiveness no one but the pain of a wise man receives it and does not receive it. flee!
